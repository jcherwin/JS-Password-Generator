# JS-Password-Generator

## Description

This program generates a password based on user criteria (length and character types) which they choose after clicking a button on the page that has had an event listener tied to it through the embeded JavaScript. There is input validation to ensure that the user enters a number value between 8 and 128 for the password length and also selects at least one character type.

This program utilizes different aspects of JavaScript such as: objects, functions, for and while loops, arrays, prompts, and event listeners.
